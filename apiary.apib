# Vogel het uit
The *Vogel het uit* service for sharing gps tracks (trips), assigning points of interest, attaching questions to poi, recieving answers and building trip story.

# Architecture

![Architecture](http://sverhoeven.github.io/vogelhetuit-api/Architecture.svg "Schema")

# Formatting

- Geo data must be in [GeoJSON](http://www.geojson.org) format.
- Timestamps must be in [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ) format.

# Authentication

Use `/login` to authenticate and use returned cookie to authentication for other routes.
Routes which require *anonymous* role can be requested without authentication.

# Filtering

To filter a collection, you can append (? or &)&lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt; to the url.
The &lt;property&gt; should be the name of a field and &lt;value&gt; is the value you want to filter by.
Multiple filters can be used.
Filters which can't be specified using  &lt;property&gt;=&lt;value&gt; like spatial filters will be listed seperately.

# Pagination

For urls with collections use `page` query attribute (defaults to 1). The default pagesize is 10 and can be changed with `pagesize` query attribute.

Example on `/species?page=3&pagesize=20`:

+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
            "total": 0,
            "items": []
        }

# Sorting

To sort a collection, you can append  ?order=&lt;field1&gt;,&lt;field2&gt; asc,&lt;field3&gt; desc.

# Multi lingual

The text fields which can be filled with this API should be made in the language for the target audience.
Any errors will be in English. The website/app is responsible to translate it for the user.

# Read-only attributes

The following attributes are read-only, when set during creating or update they will be silently ignored:
* The '_links' attribute is a way for hyperlinking between resources. The format used is HAL, see http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html.
* The '*_by' and '*_on' attributes are updated automaticly when a user performs a change to a resources.

# Group Species
Species can be used to filter pois, trips or stories.

## Species [/species/{id}]
